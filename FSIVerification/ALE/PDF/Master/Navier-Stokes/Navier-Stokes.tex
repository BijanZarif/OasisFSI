\chapter*{Fluid equations}
The Navier-Stokes equations are derived using principles of mass and momentum conservation. These equations describes the velocity and pressure in a given fluid continuum. They are here written in the time domain $\mathcal{F}$:
\begin{align}
\rho\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \rho u \cdot \nabla u &= \nabla \cdot \sigma_f + f \\
\nabla \cdot u &= 0
\end{align}
where $ \rho$ stands for constant density, f is body force and $ \sigma_f = \mu_f (\nabla u + \nabla u^T)  - pI$ \\
We will only compute incompressible fluids.
There does not yet exist a mathematical solution
