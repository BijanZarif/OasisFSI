abstract = {We introduce a class of explicit coupling schemes for the numerical solution of fluid-structure interaction problems involving a viscous incompressible fluid and a general thin-walled structure (e.g., including damping and non-linear behavior). The fundamental ingredient in these methods is a (parameter free) explicit Robin interface condition for the fluid, which enables the fluid-solid splitting through appropriate extrapolations of the solid velocity and fluid stress on the interface. The resulting solution procedures are genuinely partitioned. Stability and error estimates are provided for all the variants (depending on the extrapolations), using energy arguments within a representative linear setting. In particular, we show that one of them simultaneously yields added-mass free unconditional stability and optimal (first-order) time accuracy. A comprehensive numerical study, involving different examples from the literature, supports the theory. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents an analytical model and a geometric numerical integrator for a tethered spacecraft model that is composed of two rigid bodies connected by an elastic tether. This model includes important dynamic characteristics of tethered spacecraft in orbit, namely the nonlinear coupling between tether deformations, rotational dynamics of rigid bodies, a reeling mechanism, and orbital dynamics. A geometric numerical integrator, referred to as a Lie group variational integrator, is developed to numerically preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the presented model and its Lie group configuration manifold. The structure-preserving properties are particularly useful for studying complex dynamics of a tethered spacecraft. These properties are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

@article{Hron2006,
abstract = {We investigate a monolithic algorithm to solve the problem of time dependent interaction between an incompressible viscous fluid and an elastic solid. The continuous formulation of the problem and its discretization is done in a monolithic way, treating the problem as one continuum. The Q2/Pdis 1 finite elements are used for the discretization and an approximate Newton method with coupled multigrid linear solver is developed for solving the equations. We discuss possible efficient strategies of setting up the resulting system and its solution. A 2-dimensional configuration is presented to test the developed method. It is based on the older successful DFG benchmark flow around cylinder for incompressible laminar fluid flow. Similar to this older benchmark we consider the flow to be incompressible and in the laminar regime. The structure is allowed to be compressible or incompressible and the deformations of the structure are periodic and significant in terms of displacement. This configuration can be used to compare different numerical methods and code implementations for the fluid-structure interaction problem qualitatively and particularly quantitatively with respect to efficiency and accuracy of the computation.},

abstract = {We present an overview of the most common numerical solution strategies for the incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations, including fully implicit formulations, artificial compressibility methods, penalty formulations, and operator splitting methods (pressure/velocity correction, projection methods). A unified framework that explains popular operator splitting methods as special cases of a fully implicit approach is also presented and can be used for constructing new and improved solution strategies. The exposition is mostly neutral to the spatial discretization technique, but we cover the need for staggered grids or mixed finite elements and outline some alternative stabilization techniques that allow using standard grids. Emphasis is put on showing the close relationship between (seemingly) different and competing solution approaches for incompressible viscous flow.},
