- Create a seperate problem file, and run with command line arguments from the solver file..?
- Move BCs to problem file from weak form
- Implement single space weak form
- Optimize the non-linear solver
- Generalize solver type and parameters in order to find most efficient solution strategy

- Convex problem? Preconditioner, 8 iterations for the linear solve in the nonlinear solver, might not holde
  for a larger problem?
- Ask Joakim for the initial work of creating a block preconditioner
